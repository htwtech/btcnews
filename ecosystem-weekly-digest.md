# BTC Ecosystem Weekly Digest

Happy belated Valentine’s Day 💘
(Hope you spent it with humans, not charts).

The news flow is lighter than usual, cus half the industry is busy networking at Consensus, but we still found the signal:
* Prediction markets 2.0
* "Vibe coding" on Bitcoin
* Cross-chain yield without the bridge pain

Let's dive in!

## 1️⃣ Citrea Signals for Betting on Ranges
Polymarket offers binary outcomes (Yes/No).
Signals lets you bet on continuous price curves.
This means you can bet on specific price intervals. You can monetize your view even if the market moves sideways, not just when it pumps or dumps.

## 2️⃣ B² Network and AI Autopilot
"B² Mind" solves the complexity of DeFi interactions.
You type: "Farm stablecoins."
The AI builds the transaction route for you.
Convenient? Yes.
But stay safe: always verify the calldata before signing to ensure the AI isn't making mistakes.

## 3️⃣ Core DAO Yield for the Passive
New roadmap feature: AI agents that automatically rotate your BTC into the best yield strategies.
Key point: It remains non-custodial (Satoshi Plus).
It’s essentially an automated portfolio manager for those who don't want to micromanage APY rates daily.

## 4️⃣ Midl offers Hackathon for Prompters
"VibeHack" is live.
You don't need to be a senior Solidity dev anymore.
If you can guide Claude to write a working dApp, you can compete for the prize pool.
The barrier to entry for building on Bitcoin has never been lower.

## 5️⃣ Spicenet Cross-Chain
Elitra uses "Spice Flow" technology to farm Citrea yields directly from Base or Arbitrum.
Just one click from your main wallet. This is what seamless UX looks like.

## 6️⃣ Interport Finance bridges BOB
Integrated Chainlink CCIP for $BOB transfers.
The killer feature here is Zero Slippage.
This means you move assets 1:1, getting exactly what you sent without losing value on the spread. Secure and efficient.

## 7️⃣ Stacks and $20k Buidl Battle
Partnered with DoraHacks for a massive 3-week virtual sprint in March.
A solid opportunity for devs: Hackathons, bounties, and a $20k prize pool are up for grabs.
If you are building on Bitcoin, this is your time to prepare.

**The trend of the week is Abstraction & AI.**
Neural networks are taking over the strategy (Core, B²), while tech like Spicenet handles the bridging logic.
The tools are getting smarter and easier to use.

See you next week 🫡
