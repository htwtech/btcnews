PSA: BOB Governance rules changed on Monday.

If you have not touched your $BOB delegation since the snapshot, you need to check this.

The mechanics shifted.

The 5% APR boost now only applies if you delegate to a whitelisted delegate. Everyone else receives 0% boost.

We are seeing many setups untouched since December. That is idle capital.

HighTower is a verified whitelisted delegate. If you want to keep your rewards compounding at full speed, you can move your delegation accordingly.

Here is how to fix it.

Go to the staking dashboard.  
Open the Governance Boost tab.  
Find HighTower in the list.

It takes 30 seconds.

Do not bleed yield while others compound.
