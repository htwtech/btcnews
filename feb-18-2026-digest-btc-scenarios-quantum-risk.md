# Feb 18, 2026 | Digest: market narratives, quantum risks, and two scenarios for BTC

## What's on the table today

We're looking at three things that shaped the conversation over the last 24 hours: dollar positioning hitting historic extremes, a serious warning from CryptoQuant about quantum vulnerability, and two very different paths forward for Bitcoin's price. And the three are connected.

## Dollar pessimism is at a decade high, and BTC didn't react

Futures data shows short positioning on the USD is the weakest since at least 2012. The DXY was hovering near 96.9, Bank of America confirmed portfolios are underweight the dollar, and the general macro bet is that the Fed cuts rates. Classic setup for a BTC rally, right?

Yet BTC moved alongside the dollar. The 90-day correlation between BTC and the dollar index recently hit 0.60 — the highest since April 2025. During 2025, the dollar dropped roughly 9% and BTC fell 6%. Both continued sliding into early 2026.

The more important change is the correlation itself. What we're seeing is Bitcoin behaving more like a risk-on equity than a macro hedge. That shift changes how macro models read BTC.

A few things to keep in mind:

- Crowded short positions on the dollar could trigger a squeeze  
- A squeeze would lift the dollar — and possibly BTC alongside it, for the wrong reasons  

There's no simple macro read here.

## 6.89 million BTC and the quantum exposure debate

Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, put numbers on a risk the ecosystem tends to avoid discussing directly: roughly 6.89 million BTC may be vulnerable to quantum attacks. Around 3.4 million of those haven't moved in over a decade — including what's widely assumed to be Satoshi's ~1 million BTC.

Ju's proposal is to freeze all pre-2010 coins until Bitcoin adopts quantum-resistant cryptography. The technical side is the easier part — quantum-resistant signatures exist.

The harder question is whether the community would ever sanction rewriting the ledger to protect coins that haven't moved in fifteen years, including what most people assume is Satoshi's stash. That's not a cryptography problem. Global consensus on something this foundational is a political problem, and Bitcoin governance doesn't move fast on hard calls.

## Two distinct scenarios for BTC recovery

CryptoQuant's current read on BTC recovery outlines two scenarios:

- **Scenario A — Capitulation to ~$55k.**  
  Large holders offload, shorter-term holders exit, and a rebound sets up from lower ground. A sharper reset before rebuilding momentum.

- **Scenario B — Prolonged sideways.**  
  A $60k–$70k range for several months, ETF inflows slowing, new investor demand weak, institutions quietly diversifying out of BTC. The estimate is three or more months of consolidation before momentum returns.

CryptoQuant does not expect meaningful altcoin rotation in the near term.

In both scenarios, the near-term outlook remains slow. Positioning looks very different under each.

We lean toward Scenario B as the base case, mostly because the macro backdrop doesn't offer a clean catalyst. Harvard's endowment recently trimmed BTC-ETF exposure and increased allocation to BlackRock's ether trust — not decisive on its own, but directionally consistent with broader caution.

That's the landscape as of today. The quantum freeze proposal, in particular, feels like it could become a genuine governance flashpoint in the next cycle.
